# Working in this repository

A minimal Zola static site with one dossier page. Read this before changing
content or templates.

## Content about real parties

The default is self-only unless explicitly extended. It has been extended.

### Authorized subject: Petr Macinka and Filip Turek (on the record)

Authorized by the site owner (korczis@gmail.com), **explicitly and on the
record, 2026-07-21**: `/dossier/` (source `content/dossier.md`) may carry a
neutral, source-cited overview of the public political controversy
surrounding **Petr Macinka** (chairman of Motoristé sobě, member of
government) and **Filip Turek** (MP, at the time government commissioner for
the Green Deal), specifically the traffic accident involving Turek's car and
an ambulance, the political fallout, and Macinka's public defense of Turek.
Both subjects are public officials acting in their public capacity; the
dossier covers only reporting already published by mainstream Czech media
(ČT24, Blesk, Echo24, Info.cz, ČeskéNoviny.cz, iRozhlas.cz, HlídacíPes.org,
Život v Česku) and cites each claim to its source.

Rules for this dossier:

- Every factual claim must cite a named, reputable, independent public
  source with a direct URL. If a claim cannot be sourced, cut it.
- Direct quotes are marked as quotes and attributed; they are not endorsed
  or restated as this site's own assessment.
- Opinion/commentary pieces (e.g. the HlídacíPes column) are labeled as
  opinion, not fact, and kept visually/structurally separate from the
  factual timeline.
- The outcome of the police investigation into the accident was not
  determined at time of writing. The dossier does not assert guilt or
  wrongdoing — it reports what has been publicly reported, including the
  fact that the matter is unresolved.
- `updated` / `reviewed_at` in `content/dossier.md` front matter should only
  be bumped when the page has actually been re-checked against current
  reporting — this is an active, developing story.

This authorization does **not** extend to any further named subject beyond
Macinka and Turek in the scope of this specific controversy, without a new,
separate, on-record owner decision.

## Metadata
